Illustrator-Scripts
===================

Some handy scripts, very basic nothing fancy.


createLayersForSelectedItemsAndNameThem.jsx
-
Sometimes you just want to wrap pageItems in layers and pass their names to  their new parentlayer.
Nothing more, nothing less is happening here.
First make sure, you have the script located in your scriptsfolder (You have to restart Illustrator afterwards).
Select the elements you want to have wrapped on your artboard – not in the layerspallet!
Run the script… tadaaa!

-
What’s not so nice?
If you only select a few, not all pageItems in a layer, your stackingorder might get mixed up, because the newly created layers will always be placed on top.



MoveLayersOfSelectedObjectsToTopLevel.jsx
-
It's name is programm. Nested Objects are moved to documents toplevel.
